# Me frontend

## Installation

Clone this project and use yarn for build.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gaconkzk/fliesml
cd fliesml
yarn
```

We can start working on the project (livereload) with command:

```shell
yarn start
```

> Note: currently the `@riotjs/compiler` having bug, so we need to use the fixed `dev` branch.
